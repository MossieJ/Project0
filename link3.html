        <h1>Theme:</h1>
        <p>Throughout this website the background theme is gaming. Why ?
            this page will explain it.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Human creativity</li>
            <li>Human cruelty</li>
            <li>Compassion</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>War</li>
            <li>Peace</li>
            <li>Possiblities</li>
            <li>Personalities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Titles:</h2>
        <p>The following titles has been the backbone of some of the things I learned and cherish. I believe games can teach something and we need to be perseptive to the smaller details that these titles can teach.</p>
        <div class="grid">
            <div class="grid-item">Call of Duty Series</div>
            <div class="grid-item">October 2003 - current</div>
            <div class="grid-item">My very first game was Call of Duty World at War on PS2. The Call of Duty campaighn series is very unique, offering emotional stories, heartfelt loss and epicly badass moments.</div>
            <div class="grid-item">Battlefield 3 and 4</div>
            <div class="grid-item">Battlefield 3: October 2011
                Battlefield 4: October 2013
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">Battlefield 3 and 4 offers an amazing campaign set in modern day war, with unique situations, destructible environments and amazing graphical details. Battlefield has been one of my favorite games for online and offline gameplay and level of hardcore mechanics. I always wanted to join the military, this game let's me live some of that fantasy from the comfort of my home.</div>
            <div class="grid-item">Assassin's Creed series</div>
            <div class="grid-item">2007-current</div>
            <div class="grid-item">Assassin's Creed is one of the most memorable titles ever created. Live in different time Eras as an assassin to fight the power and greed of the Templars, assassinating, sabotage and spying on them to stop them from gaining world dominating power. My favorite would be Assassins Creed 4: Black Flag, fighting as pirates and stopping the templars from getting the Ultimate Ancient Spying Machine.</div>
            <div class="grid-item">War Thunder</div>
            <div class="grid-item">2012</div>
            <div class="grid-item">A Free-To-Play MMO featuring war vehicles (incl. tanks, planesand warships) fighting over objectives. This simulation style game features module destruction, ammo racking, bombing players and objectives, shooting down planes and taking out the very crew manning a vehicle. With deep detail in destruction, sounds and graphics, this game provides a unique experience that few games can provide. Over 1500 war vehicles from th 1930's up to the 1990's, great sound and graphical quality, this game is worth a try.</div>
            <div class="grid-item">Cyberpunk 2077</div>
            <div class="grid-item">Release: 17 September 2020</div>
            <div class="grid-item">Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most anticipated games ever. Kill, steal, deal, build yourself and strive in the futuristic setting of 2077. Replace limbs and bodyparts with computer chips, prosthetic weapons and limbs to become a deadly foe in the midst of gangs, corporations and corruption. I can not wait for this game and I hope CD Projekt Red will live up to the expectations of their millions of fans.</div>
