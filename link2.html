        <h2>About Hobbies:</h2>

        <h3>Paintball:</h3>
        <p>I have been fascinated by paintball my entire life. From a very young age I wanted to be in the military, but due to political reasons I'd rather do the next best thing.
        </p>
        <p>I had a group of friends I played with. Every weekend we'd go to paintball fields in the surrounding area and play with other enthusiasts. We loved to socialize and get to know other people with the same interests as us.</p>
        <p>We played in a variety of maps such as semi-urban, forests, open fields and balloon blow-up courses. Personally I love urban and forest maps, even though I suck at blending in.</p>
        <p>Soon our hobby would fade out as more and more people had other responsibilities or issues, causing the casual playerbase to dilute a bit. It caused that we were stuck with professionals at the end of the day.
            They were way too competitive, we as casual players couldn't keep up to the skill and speed at which these players would play.
        </p>

        <h3>Gaming:</h3>
        <p>You probably noticed the theme throughout my pages with the background of some popular games. I love Gaming, the stories and the epic moments it provides!</p>
        <p>I started gaming when I was 4 years old. My first platform was a console from the 90's (I cant even remember the name) that had cartridges with 8-bit mario and tank games. Duckhunt was my father's favorite, but 4 year old me was too scared for the dog jumping up at me in the game.</p>
        <p>I had a lot of consoles, from the PlayStation 2, WII, PSP (PlayStation Portable) and Computers.
            My favorate platform is PC, since I was 6 y/o until now I've been a PC gamer.
        </p>
        <p>I love playing online, competitive, casual and offline Single story games. The stories a game portray has been an important part for me, since it is really like an interactive movie. Call of Duty, Battlefield and Grand Theft Auto are some of my favorite titles for stories.
            They offer great, sometimes emotional stories that intrigue me. I love military stories, action packed stories with betrayal, love and villians.
        </p>
        <p>Gaming has always been a part of me, I hope i will be able to enjoy it for a very long time.</p>

        <h3>Hiking:</h3>
        <p>I was fortunate enough to be in a school that had a Nature Club. We would go hiking different parts of our region up to 3 times a term. It birthed a sense of appreciation for nature and exploring beyond the places I know of, especially in the company of my friends and weekend of relaxation.</p>
        <p>We would hike through valleys, over mountains, through caves and between cliffs. The breathtaking moment when we arrived at our camp after a 7km hike, only to find a hut built on the edge of a cliff, overlooking a valley, the mountains on the other side and a waterfall with a pool underneath us. These moments created an ambition for travelling, exploring our beautiful world in all its glory!</p>

        <h3>Travelling:</h3>
        <p>Linking to the hiking, I set my mind to travelling and my first target was Vietnam.</p>
        <p>My friend and I set out to Vietnam to travel and teach (English). My friend has an uncle living in Vietnam, he was a great help to get us documents and help us understand Vietnam. Vietnam is absolutely amazing, beautiful and awesome.</p>
        <p>The people of Vietnam are very friendly, always willing to help and show you around. Of course they will try their luck to get as much money from foreigners as possible, but I've learnt how to work with them and where to go to save money and still live like kings. After working with them for a year, I've learnt about their way of business.
        Travelling in Vietnam is special, from amusement parks to beaches, clubs to restaurants, all these places is unique in their own way. Most restaurant you sit on the street on a small chair and a plastic table, making you feel like your in kindergarden again. 
        Clubs are lively and exciting, but expensive. That is why you always move in groups. We used to go to clubs in groups of 5 or more, dancing, drinking and having fun.
        </p>
        <p>The best part of Vietnam, was travelling between towns and random road trips. When I wasn't teaching I would take a few days, take my girl and a bike, and head into the mountains and see where the road takes me. Beautiful mountain ranges to unique towns, every mile was something to see.
            spending a night at the local backpackers, just to socialize and go out and meet new people, was one of the best ways I could spend my time there.
