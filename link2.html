        <h2>About Hobbies:</h2>

        <h3>Paintball:</h3>
        <p>I have been fascinated by paintball my eentire life. From a very young age I wanted to be in the military, but due to political reasons I would rather do the next best thing.
        </p>
        <p>Ii had a group of friends I played with. Every weekend we would go to paintball fields in the surrounding area and play with other enthusiasts. We loved to socialize and get to know other people with the same interests as us.</p>
        <p>We played in a variety of maps such as semi-urban, forests, open fields and balloon blow-up courses. Personally I love urban and forest maps, even though I suck at blending in.</p>
        <p>Soon our hobby would fade out as more and more people had other responsibilities or issues, causing the casual playerbase to dilute a bit. It caused that we were stuck with professionals at the end of the day.
            They were way too competitive, we as casual players couldn't keep up to the skill and speed at wich these players would play.
        </p>

        <h3>Gaming:</h3>
        <p>You probably noticed the theme throughout my pages with the background of some popular games. I love Gaming, the stories and the epic moments it provides</p>
        <p>I started gaming when I was 4 years old. My first platform was a console from the 90's (I cant even remember the name) that had cartridges with 8-bit mario and tank games. Duckhunt was my father's favorite, but 4 year old me was too scared for the dog jumping up at me in the game.</p>
        <p>I had a lot of consoles, from the PlayStation 2, WII, PSP (PlayStation Portable) and Computers.
            My favorate platform will be Computers, since I was 6 y/o until now I have been a PC gamer.
        </p>
        <p>I love playing online, competitive, casual and offline Single story games. The stories a game portray has been an important part for me, since it is really like an interactive movie. Call of Duty, Battlefield and Grand Theft Auto are some of my favorite titles for stories.
            They offer great, sometimes emotional stories that intrigued me. I love military stories, action packed stories with betrayal, love and villians.
        </p>
        <p>Gaming has always been a part of me, I hope i will be able to enjoy it for a very long time.</p>
