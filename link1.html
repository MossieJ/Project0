        <h3>About School:</h3>
        <p>
            I was fortunate enough to be in a school that had the best ocean view EVER!
            Whether it was lunch breaks or the transition between classes, you would always be looking over the ocean.
            My school is placed on top of a hill overlooking the town, ocean and the shoreline and mountains on the other side of the bay.
        </p>
        <p>The sport stadium was near the school (maybe about 500m). It has 5 big sport fields for rugby, hockey, soccer and even athletics. In the right hand corner there is 3 netball courts and a clubhouse.
            The stadium overlooks 3 of the Rugby fields, the cliffs on the far side and the ocean surrounding us from right to left (180 degrees ocean view).
            It truly is beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>I've learnt a lot from my friends as well, they taught me how to have fun and play games. I used to work way too hard. Thus I started playing videogames and building computers.</p>
